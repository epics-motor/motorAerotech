DESIGN NOTES
============

- The EPICS driver neither reads nor writes the Ensemble's soft limits.  It is
recommended that the Ensemble soft limits be disabled and the user rely on the
EPICS motor record soft limits.

- Since the Ensemble network connection requires period communication from the
host to prevent the Ensemble from closing the network socket, the Ensemble
support based on the old device driver architecture will be removed after R5-6.
The asyn motor architecture supports continuous, periodic updates; the old
architecture does not.

- This driver assumes that the EOT limit switches have been configured
correctly.  If the PosScaleFactor parameter is positive, then a positive move
is a move in the direction of the CW EOT limit switch and a negative move is a
move in the direction of the CCW EOT limit switch.  If the PosScaleFactor
parameter is negative, then a positive move is a move in the direction of the
CCW EOT limit switch and a negative move is a move in the direction of the CW
EOT limit switch


ENSEMBLE CONFIGURATION NOTES
============================


- Set the "Idle Polling" parameter the EnsembleAsynConfig() call <=
InetSock1ActiveTimeSec Parameter.  This will prevent the Ensemble
from closing the socket.


DRIVER LIMITATIONS
------------------

The driver reads the controllers configuration information only at boot-up
(iocInit). If any of the following Ensemble parameters are changed, EPICS
must be rebooted.

- CfgFbkPosType
- PosScaleFactor
- HomeOffset
- HomeDirection
- LimitLevelMask
